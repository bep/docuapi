[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/49111249-0a1a-4b5a-a3ab-45d00732fdb3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/docuapi/deploys)

**DocuAPI** is a beautiful multilingual API documentation theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). This theme is built on top of the beautiful work of [Robert Lord](https://github.com/lord) and others on the [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate) project ([Apache 2 License](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/blob/master/LICENSE)). The JS part has recently been rewritten from Jquery to [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/).

## Use

Import the theme in your Hugo config:

```toml
[[module.imports]]
path = "github.com/bep/docuapi/v2"
```

Note, if you want the older jQuery-version, replace the path with `github.com/bep/docuapi`.

If you want to edit the SCSS styles, you need:

* The extended Hugo version.
* PostCSS CLI (run `npm install` to install requirements)

See the [exampleSite](https://github.com/bep/docuapi/tree/master/exampleSite) and more specific its site [configuration](https://github.com/bep/docuapi/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) for the available options.

**Most notable:** This theme will use all the (non drafts) pages in the site and build a single-page API documentation. Using `weight` in the page front matter is the easiest way to control page order.

If you want a different page selection, please provide your own `layouts/index.html` template.

You can customize the look-and-feel by adding your own CSS variables in `assets/scss/docuapi_overrides.scss`. See the exampleSite folder for an example.

## Hooks

You can override the layouts by providing some custom partials:

* `partials/hook_head_end.html` is inserted right before the `head` end tag. Useful for additional styles etc.
* `partials/hook_body_end.html` which should be clear by its name.
* `partials/hook_left_sidebar_start.html` the start of the left sidebar
* `partials/hook_left_sidebar_end.html` the end of the left sidebar
* `partials/hook_left_sidebar_logo.html` the log `img` source

The styles and Javascript import are also put in each partial and as such can be overridden if really needed:

* `partials/styles.html`
* `partials/js.html`
